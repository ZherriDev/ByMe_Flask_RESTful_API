## ‚Ñπ About the Project
This project was developed during our internship at the company ByMe - Information Technology, Lda. based in Porto, Portugal.

This was our first experience having contact with slightly more complex projects like this. This Flask API is just the back-end of the project, 
the front-end is found in this organization's repository:
[ByMe_Flutter_App](https://github.com/byme-internship-project/ByMe_Flutter_APP)

The main objective of the API is to provide a robust and scalable interface for managing clinical data such as patient information, appointment scheduling, and medical records. 
The API facilitates communication between the mobile application developed in Flutter and the server, ensuring that data is transferred quickly and securely.
